the concept of string used in c, c++, java, python,etc
in c and c++ string is considered as character array end with \0
but in java string considered as object it contains character array
in case of java there is no \0 at end of string becouse used length property
using length property we can find number of character in string
java is network base programming language 
most frequenctly used datatype of string

java there are rpovide three inbuild classes

1 string
2 string buffer
3 string builder

string: string is imutable object menas if try to change containse of string then jvm create new memory and apply changes of that memory

there are three way to create memory
1) char arr[] = {'H','E','L','L','O'}
   String str1 = new String(arr)
   
2) String str2 = new String("Hello");

3) String str3 = "Hello";

in above syntax when if create string using new key word it becomes string object
                where if create string without using new keyword it become a string litter
				
				we create string using new key word then memory gets allocated inside heap memory section
				create string using new key word is called as string object'
				string object non sharable
				
				we create string without using new keyword is called as string literal
				create string without using new keyword memory get allocated inside string constant pool
				
				if string create using string literal then JVM first check string available or not
				if string is available then only increment the refernce cout of same string
				
				if string not available in pool the it create new memory of string
